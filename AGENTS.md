# AGENTS.md

Binding project rules live in **`.ai-rules/`**. Read the relevant files before
making changes. Do not duplicate rule bodies here.

Workflow overview: **`docs/ai-workflows.md`** · Two-agent review:
**`docs/two-agent-review-workflow.md`**

After every non-trivial file-changing task, Codex MUST run a read-only
Reviewer before the final response: first try cross-provider review via
`scripts/ai/invoke-cross-reviewer.sh claude`, falling back to native
same-provider `codex review --uncommitted` via
`scripts/ai/invoke-cross-reviewer.sh codex` if Claude is unavailable. No
second user prompt, pasted handoff, local runner command, or separate CLI
window is required. The final response must include the Builder summary and
Reviewer verdict. Read-only or trivial tasks may skip Reviewer only with an
explicit reason. See `.ai-rules/agent-orchestration.md` §8 for the full
decision tree and `.ai-rules/model-routing.md` for model/tier selection.

## Binding rules (`.ai-rules/`)

### Core
- `repository.md` — scope, config hygiene, enforcement split
- `architecture.md` — layers, dependencies
- `api.md` — routes, auth, versioning
- `database.md` — SQLAlchemy, Alembic, destructive migrations
- `security.md` — secrets, auth, production validators
- `tenancy.md` — tenant isolation
- `workers.md` — job queue and Redis compatibility
- `testing.md` — pytest requirements and test integrity
- `docker.md` — Compose and production runtime safety
- `documentation.md` — README, docs, tracking files
- `git.md` — branches, commits (no AI attribution trailers), push/merge approval
- `anti-overengineering.md` — avoid unnecessary abstractions, files, dependencies

### Workflow (how to work)
- `agent-orchestration.md` — start every task here
- `model-routing.md` — model/tier selection and cross-provider review
- `context-map.md` — task type → files to read
- `spec-driven-development.md` — specs for non-trivial work
- `planning-and-task-breakdown.md` — task cards and ordering
- `incremental-work.md` — thin slices and validation cadence
- `tdd-and-regression.md` — failing test first, coverage expectations
- `review.md` — pre-merge checklist
- `learning-mode.md` — mentor-style completion format for non-trivial tasks
- `threat-modeling.md` — auth, tenancy, uploads, webhooks, workers
- `template-onboarding.md` — clone into a new product (agent workflow)

## Optional (not binding)

- **`agents/`** — review personas (backend, security, tenancy, DB, CI, onboarding)
- **`.commands/`** — prompt formats and procedures (spec, plan, builder
  handoff, two-agent review, audit, onboard)
- **`docs/two-agent-review-workflow.md`** — Builder / Reviewer handoff pattern
- **`docs/learning/`** — code-verified mental maps and interview defense
- **`docs/specs/`** — feature spec conventions
- **`docs/decisions/`** → ADRs in **`docs/adr/`**

## Validation

- Application code: `make validate`
- CI policy: `make policy-guards`
- AI workflow files: `make validate-ai-workflows`

Mechanical checks: `docs/ci-policy-guards.md`.

Update `.ai-rules/` when changing project rules. Keep this file as an index only.
